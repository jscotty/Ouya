# Ouya
Project GameLab#1 <br>

My first game for OUYA
With project medialab we had the opertunity to create a game or application with new technology like: Oculus, neurosky mind wave, leap motion, OUYA and more. I decided to create a game with the OUYA because of the touch pad.
I had never touched an OUYA before.<br><br>
After all did we found out that the touchpad from the OUYA controller is not that suitable for drawnings. But i learned a lot: I learned to create fast prototyping in 3D with controllers. I learned to create drawning feature with Unity3D C#, and how to create a game for children. <br><br>
